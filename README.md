# school-scripts
This is a repository of different javascript codes that you can run in the javascript console (Or search bar using "javascript:"). These codes are meant to cure boredom online. IF YOU USE THESE SCRIPTS MALICIOUSLY IN ANY WAY I WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I'm not sure how but I know that someone could probably find a way.


# Use of Scripts
To use the scripts you may either...

1. do "ctrl+i" and navigate to the console where you can paste them and press enter.
2. type "javascript:" into the search bar and paste the script behind it then press enter.
3. type "javascript:" and paste the script behind it then save as a bookmark for repeated use.

# What Do They Do?

1. Inspect lets you temporarily edit the text on the page.
2. Reverse inspect reverts the page to normal so that you can not edit the text anymore but you can still see any text previously edited.
(Note that reloading the page will undo any edited elements.)
3. Autoclicker clicks around 100 times every second when you hold down the primary mouse button.
(TIP: avoid using the autoclicker on links or buttons. This can result in lots of tabs being opened/files being downloaded which as a result can harm your computer)


More scripts will be added in the future...
