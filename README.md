# school-scripts
This is a repository of different javascript codes that you can run in the javascript console (Or search bar using "javascript:"). These codes are meant to cure boredom online. IF YOU USE THESE SCRIPTS MALICIOUSLY IN ANY WAY I WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I'm not sure how but I know that someone could probably find a way.


# Use of Scripts
To use the scripts you may either...

1. do "ctrl+i" and navigate to the console where you can paste them and press enter.
2. type "javascript:" into the search bar and paste the script behind it then press enter.
3. type "javascript:" and paste the script behind it then save as a bookmark for repeated use.
