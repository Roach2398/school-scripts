This is a repository of different javascript codes that you can run in the javascript console (Or search bar using "javascript:"). These codes are meant to cure boredom online. IF YOU USE THESE SCRIPTS MALICIOUSLY IN ANY WAY I WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I'm not sure how but I know that someone could probably find a way.
